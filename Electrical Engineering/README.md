# Electrical Engineering Resources 

If you're a new EE student or simply just interested in electrical engineering projects and know hows! We've assembled some resources for you so that you can use them in your labs, your own personal projects, design teams or work in the ECSESS Factory!

## Circuit Resources
* [Electronics Tutorial](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/) - This site has some pretty nice explanation for circuit concepts involving your standard circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, Op Amps, AC Vs DC.

* [Circuit Online Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/) - Falstad's circuit simulator web app is a nice way to test circuits without having to build them. It creates custom virtual electronic components that you man map together to make your circuit and you can gather measurements from the components as well!

* [Circuits Component tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGI9d0CjI8s&index=1&list=PLYS_1w0FFIANdG78JyJu3tsumsXVIcXUB) - This videos resource covers electrical theory and tutorials on electronic components

## Signal Processing
* [Signal processing 101](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/our-story/signal-processing-101) - This is a great source for learning about signals basics and may help you with ecse 206


## On Campus Resources
* [The Factory](https://www.facebook.com/ecsessfactory/) - The Factory is a student run project lab located in Trottier 0080! We offer free rentals and equipment for student side projects!

* [The Cube](https://www.facebook.com/thecube3dprinting/) - The Cube is a lab in the MacDonald Engineering building in Room 264! They provide access to 3D Printers that you can use to create parts for your DIY projects



## Project Ideas
* [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/technology/) - This is a great DIY website that provides tutorials on how to make some neat electronic gadgets!

* [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/) - This website sells a bunch of great electronics but also gives great tutorials on what you can do with those electronics
