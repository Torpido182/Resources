# Resources 
A handful of programming resources that have helped me along my way :)
I hope they prove to be useful and help you progress!


## Programming Languages
If you've never programmed before, let's start off by picking up a language to write your code in! Keep in mind that depending on the task you are doing, some languages might be easier to use than others! Every Language has a purpose

* Java, C, Python, Javascript ,C++, C# and many more!




## Programming Tutorials
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Great hands on lessons to teach basic syntax for programming languages, has an in browser editor to run code
* [Tutorial Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm) - Doesn't have hands on code editor but this is a great site to get a more extensive list of syntax and to use for reference
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Great resource for learning web technologies and has you learning and later on building projects! (Has an in browser text editor)
* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/) - This web site has small interactive questions to test you after the lesson which is nice. The Nice thing about this organization is that it has offline apps that you can download to learn your lessons on the go!
