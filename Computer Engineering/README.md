# Computer Engineering Resources 

If you're a new CE student or simply just interested in hardware and software related projects and know hows! We've assembled some resources for you so that you can use them in your labs, your own personal projects, design teams or work in the ECSESS Factory!

# Math Resources
* [Paul's Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) - This is a resource that covers Calculus and Ordinary differential Equations. You can download Pdfs of all the notes so this is a great way to find great explanation to math concepts will see in U0-U2

* [betterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/cheatsheet/) - This site extends beyond calculus and has some notes on linear, euler, fourier transforms, stats and many other mathematical topics.

# Computer Engineering Assets
* [Computer Fundamentals](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_fundamentals/index.htm) - This source is a small intro to the main components of a computer and what they are used for. 

* [Computer Architecture](https://www.studytonight.com/computer-architecture/) - Guide on computer architecture and organization. This is also a good follow up on the computer fundamentals above.

* [CS crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) - Crash course provides some great videos for a quick rundown on CS concepts 



# Organizations
* [Roboelectronics](https://ere.mcgilleus.ca/) - A great club to learn hands-on skills in electronics and robotics to McGill students with all levels of experience.
